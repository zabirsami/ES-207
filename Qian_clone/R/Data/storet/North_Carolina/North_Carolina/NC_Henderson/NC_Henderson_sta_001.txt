The sampling location is within the boundary of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site in Front Lake. Sampling was conducted at this location by James P. Swigert in 1977 and 1978 in fulfillment of his thesis; "A Biological and Physical-Chemical Characterization of Two Ponds Each Accommodating Either Agricultural or Urban Runoff" in 1979 from Tennessee Technological University.  The purpose of the effort was to characterize the physical-chemical status of the two impoundments (Front (East) and Side (West)); analyze bottom sediments; quantify nutrient loads; evaluate phytoplankton communities; and appraise benthic macroinvertebrates.  The study was conducted to be able to compare pre- and post-dredge aquatic environments.
